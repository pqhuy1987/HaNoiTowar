# Hanoi
Simple Tower of Hanoi app that demonstrates SpriteKit, Storyboards, and Swift.

## About
This app was created purely in Swift. It uses Apple's Storyboards and SpriteKit framework to present a simple interactive game on iOS devices. To build the app yourself, simply clone this repository and import it as a project in Xcode. It should be able to build out of the box, although you may need to be using the latest developer preview of Xcode.
